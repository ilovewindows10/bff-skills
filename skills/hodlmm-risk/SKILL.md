# HODLMM Risk Skill

## What it does

Monitors HODLMM (DLMM) pool volatility and LP risk on Bitflow. Computes bin spread, reserve imbalance, and concentration metrics to classify market regime and emit position-sizing signals.

## Why agents need it

Agents managing HODLMM liquidity need a risk gate before adding, holding, or withdrawing. This skill provides that gate — a numeric volatility score and regime label that downstream agents can use to decide whether to act.

## Safety notes

- Read-only — never writes to chain or moves funds.
- Mainnet only — Bitflow HODLMM APIs are mainnet-only.
- No wallet or funds required.
- Pools with all-zero reserves return an error rather than misleading metrics.

## Commands

### assess-pool

Assess volatility and risk metrics for a HODLMM pool.

```
bun run skills/hodlmm-risk/hodlmm-risk.ts assess-pool --pool-id <pool_id>
```

Options:
- `--pool-id` (required) — HODLMM pool identifier (e.g. `dlmm_3`)

Output:
```json
{
  "network": "mainnet",
  "poolId": "dlmm_3",
  "activeBinId": 447,
  "totalBins": 69,
  "binSpread": 0.034,
  "reserveImbalanceRatio": 0.72,
  "volatilityScore": 38,
  "regime": "calm",
  "signals": {
    "safeToAddLiquidity": true,
    "recommendedBinWidth": 5,
    "maxExposurePct": 0.25
  },
  "timestamp": "2026-03-24T20:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### assess-position

Assess risk for a specific wallet's HODLMM position in a pool.

```
bun run skills/hodlmm-risk/hodlmm-risk.ts assess-position --pool-id <pool_id> [--address <stx_address>]
```

Options:
- `--pool-id` (required) — HODLMM pool identifier
- `--address` (optional) — Stacks address to check (uses wallet default if omitted)

Output:
```json
{
  "network": "mainnet",
  "poolId": "dlmm_3",
  "address": "SP2...",
  "positionBinCount": 3,
  "activeBinId": 447,
  "nearestPositionBinOffset": 2,
  "avgBinOffset": 4.33,
  "concentrationRisk": "medium",
  "driftScore": 22,
  "impermanentLossEstimatePct": 1.76,
  "recommendation": "rebalance",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-24T20:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### regime-snapshot

Get a single-point volatility regime snapshot for a pool.

```
bun run skills/hodlmm-risk/hodlmm-risk.ts regime-snapshot --pool-id <pool_id>
```

Options:
- `--pool-id` (required) — HODLMM pool identifier

Output:
```json
{
  "network": "mainnet",
  "poolId": "dlmm_3",
  "volatilityScore": 38,
  "regime": "calm",
  "activeBinId": 447,
  "binSpread": 0.034,
  "reserveImbalanceRatio": 0.72,
  "note": "Single-point snapshot. For trend analysis, store snapshots externally over time.",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-24T20:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Output contract

All outputs are JSON to stdout. On error:
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": "descriptive error message"
}
```

## Known constraints

- Mainnet only — Bitflow HODLMM APIs do not exist on testnet.
- No wallet required — all operations are read-only.
- Volatility score ranges 0-100: 0-30 = calm, 31-60 = elevated, 61-100 = crisis.
- Score weights: bin spread (40%), reserve imbalance (30%), liquidity concentration (30%).
- `driftScore` is derived from `avgBinOffset` (average distance of position bins from active bin).
- `regime-snapshot` returns a single point-in-time reading. For trend analysis, store snapshots externally over time.
- Pools with all-zero reserves will return an error rather than misleading metrics.
